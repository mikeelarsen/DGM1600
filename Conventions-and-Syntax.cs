    //Classes inherit sets of traits which are defined here:
    //for examples: if we use the class "Mammal", most mammals have:
    //Fur/hair
    //2 eyes
    //four legs/limbs
    //a tail
    //a backbone
    //etc.

        //then we make something which inherits from the parent class,
        //an example of this would be cat, which is a sub-class of mammal.
        //cats also have whiskers
        //very flexible and dextrous
        //etc.

    //good syntax includes:
        //proper indentation
            //when something is indented within code it is easier to follow
        //using semicolons to end statements
            //this ensures the compiler knows how to parse your code.
        //writing in CamelCase
            //by capitalizingTheFirstLetter in oneLongString, you can easily
            //read variables, while still conforming with allowed syntax.
        //COMMENTING in your code
            //this is useful, not only for those who will be reading it, but
            //useful too, for you the developer to remind yourself of certain
            //stages within the functions and lines of code.
        //utilizing whitespace
            //along with indenting, adding whitespace helps the code to
            //"breath" and assists with comprehension and legibility.

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {
		
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		
	}
